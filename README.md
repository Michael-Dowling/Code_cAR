# Code [cAR]

This project is an augmented reality game designed to expose kids to programming concepts like line-by-line execution of code, using for loops, and calling functions. The game is played by writing instructions for a car to try and navigate it towards the goal in each level. As each level finishes the game gets harder and the use of more advanced techniques like looping instructions becomes more of a neccessity to avoid repeating code.

This game was developed using **Unity**, **C++** and **ARCore** and it can be uploaded and played on either an *Android* or *IOS* device.

THe project was developed as part of *QHacks 2019* and more detailed information can be found on [DEVPOST](https://devpost.com/software/code-car-g3r6eq)
